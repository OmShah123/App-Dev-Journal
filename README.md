The projects I have done are the Tic-Tac-Toe game and scheduling app from class,and created a chatting app, a to-do list app, and a random quote generator app that generates quotes from the TV Show Bojack Horseman on the side.

I created a to-do list app that allows you to add tasks, check them off, and delete completed tasks.
